Party Explorer is a simple app to sample some basic technical implementation for an iOS using Swift, such as: API integration, SwiftUI, Concunrrency and MVVM with Clean Architecture elements.

## Functionalities
✔️ Home screen displaying a list of parties details.

✔️ It's possible to filter the list of parties, and generate a new party, randomly.

## Technologies and tools used

- Swift: programming language
- SwiftUI: for building the layout
- Concurrency: for retriving the data from a mocked API, smoothly

## Architecture used

Architecture used was MVVM, with some elements of Clean Architecture. Strong reference used: <a href="https://github.com/kudoleh/iOS-Clean-Architecture-MVVM">repo.</a></p> 

Important to notice that the UseCase layer was not used to make things simpler, would be a over kill to this simple app.

## API used for integration

It merely used a JSON file to simulate the data used in the program, which would typically have come via an online API.

## How to run the project?

It is quite straightforward:

Open the Xcode Project file.
